- SEO optimized with structured data for Jonathan "JT" Wu
- WCAG compliant accessibility with proper focus states
- Current layout is approved and should be maintained

## Recent Updates (Latest Session)
**About Page Layout Redesign - Willkie-Inspired Professional Presentation:**
- **Mobile Profile Layout**: Implemented Willkie-style mobile About page with clean profile header featuring photo next to name/title, contact details with icons (üìç üìß üîó üéì üìÑ), and bio text below - maintaining beloved hero section above
- **Desktop Bio Structure**: Updated desktop bio section to match Willkie professional layout with photo/contact sidebar on left (1fr), name/title info on right (2fr), creating cleaner professional presentation
- **Contact Icons Integration**: Added contact icons throughout mobile version replacing text labels ("Email:" ‚Üí ‚úâÔ∏è) for cleaner, modern aesthetic 
- **vCard Download**: Integrated vCard download button with document icon for professional networking functionality
- **Layout Debugging**: Resolved mobile layout conflicts, logo overflow issues, and hero section integration problems through careful grid restructuring
- **Grid Optimization**: Fixed organizations grid to prevent overflow on mobile with proper max-width constraints and reduced gap spacing
- **Responsive Integration**: Ensured mobile profile section works seamlessly below existing hero sections without breaking magnolia theme or animations

**CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED FROM MISTAKES:**
- **NEVER hide hero sections** - User explicitly loves the hero sections ("Rooted in Georgia. Engaged Globally.") and wants them maintained across all pages
- **Test changes incrementally** - Made too many changes at once, breaking the bio content visibility and layout completely
- **Always preserve working functionality** - When user says something works, don't break it while trying to improve other parts
- **Mobile layout complexity** - Adding custom mobile profile sections created conflicts with existing bio content - simpler approaches work better
- **Desktop vs Mobile separation** - When user asks for desktop changes, focus ONLY on desktop without touching mobile layouts
- **Communication clarity** - User wanted Willkie-style improvements, not complete replacement of existing functional layouts

**Latest Updates (Current Session):**
- **Mobile Logo Layout Fixes (Sept 2024)**: Fixed mobile layout issues across homepage and About page where organization logos were spilling off right side of screen
- **About Page Mobile Optimization**: Reduced gap from 2rem to 1.5rem, added container constraints (`max-width: 100%`, `padding: 0 1rem`), reduced logo sizing (100px vs 140px width), optimized padding and min-height
- **Homepage Mobile Consistency**: Applied same mobile alignment improvements to match About page - reduced logo sizing (100px width, 50px height), added container constraints, consistent mobile experience
- **Standard Workflow Established**: Push changes immediately after implementation for live review on Vercel

**Previous Updates:**
- **Mobile Navigation**: Standardized hamburger menu with proper alignment (`left: 0` on pseudo-elements), solid `var(--magnolia-cream)` background, backdrop-filter blur, rounded corners, and consistent font sizing across all pages
- **Hero Section Spacing**: Fixed white bar gaps by updating hero padding to `8rem 0 5rem` for proper spacing below fixed navigation
- **Mobile Typography**: Added missing `font-size: 2.2rem` to mobile hero titles on About page, removed font-size overrides from mobile nav links to match Home page behavior
- **Animation Integration**: Successfully integrated magnolia leaf SVG patterns and fadeInUp animations across About, Advisory, and Contact pages to match homepage aesthetic
- **Notion Integration**: Added Finance Sprint advisory offering section to Advisory page with tasteful callout styling
- **Live Notion Link**: Connected Finance Sprint CTA button to live Notion page (https://striped-hammer-336.notion.site/Finance-Sprint-Unlock-What-s-Next-26697b8c04828057b527f33ee3275754) with target="_blank" for seamless user experience
- **Brand Assets**: Created custom Notion header banner using correct brand fonts (Playfair Display for titles, Inter for body) and magnolia theme colors, saved as `finance-sprint-notion-banner.png` in Website Schema folder
- **Dedicated Finance Sprint Page**: Created comprehensive `finance-sprint.html` with full content conversion from Notion to magnolia aesthetic, including hero section, process breakdown, case study cards with testimonials, and clear CTAs for booking
- **Enhanced Advisory Hero CTAs**: Added prominent dual-button CTA in Advisory hero section featuring "Strategic Advisory" consultation and "Founder Jumpstart" Finance Sprint options with structured styling (label/title/details format)  
- **CTA Button Optimization**: Refined button sizing and typography for consistent single-line text layout across desktop (320px-350px width) and mobile (340px max-width) with proper spacing and hover effects
